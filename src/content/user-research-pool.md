# Join our user research pool

**Help shape the future of London’s Data Platform**

At Data for London, we believe that the best services are created in collaboration with the people who use them. Your insights and experiences are valuable in helping us design, build, and improve the digital tools and services that support our city. By joining the user research pool, you can play a crucial role in shaping the future of London’s data services.

## What is the user research pool?

The Data for London user research pool is a community of Londoners who are willing to participate in research activities to help us understand how our services are used and how they can be improved. By joining the pool, you may be invited to participate in activities such as:

- **Interviews**: Share your thoughts directly with our research team

- **Surveys**: Provide feedback on specific topics or features

- **Usability testing**: Try out new features or services and give us your feedback on how they work

- **Workshops**: Collaborate with other users and our team to brainstorm and co-design new ideas
