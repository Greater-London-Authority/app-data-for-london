## Adding a New Dataset

If you are a data owner in the London public sector and would like to have it listed on the Data for London Library, we would be delighted to do so. The metadata you provide will be used to display links to your data resources â€“ please see the best practice guide for metadata below.

We prefer to accept API endpoints to sources available online, which we can use to extract the relevant metadata (and thus keep up to date as the source changes). Please consider how your source API can map to the required DFL Library metadata and contact [datastore@london.gov.uk](mailto:datastore@london.gov.uk).

If this is not possible for you, or if there are some metadata fields that your API cannot provide, we can still accept static metadata - please contact [datastore@london.gov.uk](mailto:datastore@london.gov.uk) to supply this information.

Please note that we cannot accept data resources themselves (e.g., Excel files or Word documents). Any resources need to therefore already exist online to be linked to, as they will not be stored directly by the Library.

If you struggle to prepare your metadata according to the guide below, please get in touch and we can work with you.

## Publishers and Accounts

To upload or edit a dataset, you must have an account on the DFL Library with administration privileges. This account must belong to a Publisher. Publishers are usually organisations, such as the Greater London Authority (GLA) or Transport for London (TfL).

Only members of a Publisher can upload new datasets or edit existing datasets via self-service. For example, only members of the TfL Publisher can add or edit TfL datasets.

If you wish to share data on the Datastore but are not a member of a Publisher, then you must submit a request to [datastore@london.gov.uk](mailto:datastore@london.gov.uk).

## Datastore Account / Publishers

If you publish data on the London Datastore, its metadata is already being picked up by the DFL Library. If you are a Datastore Publisher and your data is not being picked up, please report a [bug](#).

## Best Practice Metadata Guide

You will be asked to provide metadata to index your datasets in the Library. This includes a title and description (see below) as well as maintainer information such as a point of contact and upload frequency.

### Title

The title describes the page and will be the first item seen when searching.

Make sure titles:

- Are an accurate description of the page, letting the user know they have found the right information.
- Are written in plain language and with user needs in mind.
- Include the geographic coverage of the data.
- Include a time period for what is covered by the data.
- Are written primarily for people, not just keywords.
- Contain the main keyword or keywords relevant to the page.
- Are unique from similar pages to avoid conflicting or competing search results.

Titles should not:

- Be excessively long.
- Contain jargon or technical language.
- Include abbreviations or acronyms unless they are well known, for example, UK, GLA, or EU.

### Description

A description is a summary of a page that helps users decide if the content is what they are looking for. It appears in search engine results after the page title. A good description encourages people to select the search result to visit the page.

The description must:

- Clearly summarise what the page is about.
- Be front-loaded (in the first 200 characters) with key information.
- Be plain text.
- Make sense out of context.
- Include the main keywords, ideally at the start of the description.
- Not repeat the page title.

Search will display a relevant part of this description where it matches entered search terms.
