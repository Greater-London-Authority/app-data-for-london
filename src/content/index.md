# Data for London

The Mayor of London's Data for London programme wants to make it simpler for people to share and use data held across London to improve the city and benefit Londoners. The Greater London Authority is building a new platform for data sharing and a user-friendly service to facilitate easy data discovery.

## What is Data for London?

We believe in harnessing the power of data to solve complex challenges. From measuring air quality to optimising your travel journey, data can be used to improve our quality of life.  

Data for London is established to make it easier for people to discover, access and share data, all in one place. The programme is set up by the Mayor of London and the Greater London Authority, ensuring citizen data is used responsibly and ethically. 

Data for London provides deeper insights and prioritises the experiences of our diverse city to inform decision making. It aims to be a vital resource to researchers, policy makers and local authorities looking to deliver more effective public services for the benefit of all Londoners.

By connecting data more effectively, we can: 

- For Londoners: Provide assurance that data is used legally, ethically and safely; make city government more transparent through open data; receive better services and use data themselves. 

- For Decision-Makers: Gain deeper insights and improve decision-making on complex issues like NetZero, homelessness, or community safety. 

- For Data users: Improve or create better insights and services tailored for Londoners and those who serve them. 

- For Innovators: Cultivate innovation by fostering collaborations with the technology sector, universities, and the London community itself. 

The Data for London programme also involves work on improving city-wide information governance, establishing a strong data user community to develop the platform further and taking other actions to ensure that data is shared legally, ethically and purposefully.
