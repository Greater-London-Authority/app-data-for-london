# Frequently asked questions

## What is Data for London?

Find out more about [Data for London](https://chiefdigitalofficer4london.medium.com/towards-a-new-data-for-london-library-d95a062f30d9).

## What data cannot or will not be released?

The Greater London Authority is a public authority for the purposes of access to information legislation, including the Freedom of Information Action 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. We will not release data where such release would infringe privacy legislation and/or a contractual obligation e.g. commercial confidentiality.

## Isn’t some of this data available elsewhere?

We recognise that some organisations already provide open access to their data, and where appropriate, we have provided a direct link to their website, all available from one place. However, there are some instances where we can add value to this, for example by focussing on just the data for London, by saving you from having to download separate datasets for multiple years, or by making it available in a standardised and easy to use format.

## Will the Data for London Library duplicate information held in London.gov.uk website?

Whilst this is possible, the idea behind Data for London and the Data for London Library is to provide links to data. It will refer you to the main website to make available information in its final state, and so it will refer you to [www.london.gov.uk](http://www.london.gov.uk) where relevant.

## Will any more data be added to the Data for London Library?

We aim to add more data catalogues to the Data for London Library as they become available to the GLA through partnerships and collaboration. [Find out how you can add your data catalogue](contribute).

## How can I use the data in this site?

The license conditions under which data can be used will vary for each data package, but in general, the data held in this site can be used for most purposes, provided the Terms and Conditions of this site are not infringed. It is the responsibility of the user to adhere to the individual license conditions under which data is released (see the license details section for each data package).

## What can I do with Crown Copyright material?

Crown copyright is defined under section 163 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 as works made by officers or servants of the Crown in the course of their duties. Copyright in a work which has been assigned to the Crown lasts 70 years after the death of the person who created it. The default licence for most Crown copyright and Crown database right information is the Open Government Licence.

More detail on crown copyright can be found on The National Archives website here: [https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/.](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/.)
