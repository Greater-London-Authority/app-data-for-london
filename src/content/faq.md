# Frequently asked questions

## What is Data for London?

Find out more about [Data for London](https://chiefdigitalofficer4london.medium.com/towards-a-new-data-for-london-library-d95a062f30d9).

## What data cannot or will not be released?

The Greater London Authority is a public authority for the purposes of access to information legislation, including the Freedom of Information Action 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. We will not release data where such release would infringe privacy legislation and/or a contractual obligation e.g. commercial confidentiality.

## Isn’t some of this data available elsewhere?

We recognise that some organisations already provide open access to their data, and where appropriate, we have provided a direct link to their website, all available from one place. However, there are some instances where we can add value to this, for example by focussing on just the data for London, by saving you from having to download separate datasets for multiple years, or by making it available in a standardised and easy to use format.

## Will the Data for London Library duplicate information held in London.gov.uk website?

Whilst this is possible, the idea behind Data for London and the Data for London Library is to provide links to data. It will refer you to the main website to make available information in its final state, and so it will refer you to [www.london.gov.uk](http://www.london.gov.uk) where relevant.

## Will any more data be added to the Data for London Library?

We aim to add more data catalogues to the Data for London Library as they become available to the GLA through partnerships and collaboration. [Find out how you can add your data catalogue](contribute).

## How can I use the data in this site?

The license conditions under which data can be used will vary for each data package, but in general, the data held in this site can be used for most purposes, provided the Terms and Conditions of this site are not infringed. It is the responsibility of the user to adhere to the individual license conditions under which data is released (see the license details section for each data package).

## What can I do with Crown Copyright material?

The Office for National Statistics website contains a summary of the terms of use associated with Crown Copyright material from ONS. It explains the terms for personal and research use, plus the need for a click-use licence from OPSI for commercial or other uses. More information is available at [https://www.ons.gov.uk/copyright/index.html](http://www.ons.gov.uk/copyright/index.html).

We hope to be able to provide more information about the licensing terms for GLA-created data in due course. We are seeking advice from the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) about the best way of doing this.

## Who do I contact if I have a comment or complaint about this site?

The GLA welcomes comments about this site. In the first instance, email us at [datastore@london.gov.uk](mailto:datastore@london.gov.uk). This e-mail will be received by the Datastore Project Team. We will try to respond as soon as possible.

## Who is in charge of Data for London and the Data for London Library?

Ultimately, the Mayor of London is responsible for the Data for London Library. However, the Programme Team is led by the Chief Digital Officer, supported by the Head of Data for London and the GLA’s Digital Experience Unit.
